# Contributing

We welcome suggestions, comments, and improvements on our code to help build better products and services. We just have a few guidelines for you to follow to help you ensure your change gets implemented.

## Getting Started
Nice and easy – just make sure you have a GitHub account and fork the repository your interested in.

## Making Changes
Please avoid working directly on the master branch, create a feature branch from where you wish to base your work.

To create a feature branch base on master:
`git checkout –b feature/my_contribution master`

Make commits of logical units and check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing. Make sure your commit messages are well formatted; take a look at the GDS Git Style guide for more info.

Make sure all tests continue to pass, and ensure your change is covered by new tests.

## Submitting Changes
Push your changes to a feature branch in your fork of the repository then submit a pull request to the repository in the DVLA organisation. The DVLA development teams will keep regular tabs on pull requests and will let you know if it has been accepted or rejected.

## Raising Security Concerns
If you think you have identified a security flaw in one of our applications, you can contact the DVLA IT Security team directly using securityreports@digital.dvla.gov.uk.
